# NASDAQ-Stocks-2014-2024

My project is based on historic stocks 2014-2024. Source came from [Nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/quotes/historical), can only download up to ten years worth of historical data.

# Key Questions & Objectives

* How many shares of stocks have been traded for the day?
* What is the current trend for Nasdaq stocks?
* What is the expected closing price of each stock for the next coming year?
* What correlations, if any, can we conclude between different factors of the stock market?

# Script

Here is the structure of the script: Note this historical data will vary to keep up with current trends, therefore data will need to be redownloaded. However, Python code will remain the same given the output will produce the same goals but with a given different timeline.

1) Stocks Transforming Data
2) Stocks EDA
